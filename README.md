The Participatory Public Accounts (P.P.A.) are open dialogue mechanisms that link the authorities of the State Administration bodies with citizenship and aim to inform about the management of public policies carried out, generate a feedback process that allows collecting the concerns and contributions of its participants and give an organized response to consultations arising in the process.

For this analysis, text analysis techniques are applied in R language to the public accounts of Gendarmería de Chile corresponding to the years 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 (2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively).

Gendarmerie de Chile is a Public Service, under the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights of the State of Chile, whose mission is to contribute to a safer society, guaranteeing the effective fulfillment of preventive detention and liberty deprivation or restriction sentences to whom the courts determine, providing conditions and benefits to the affected ones according to their quality as a person and to the human rights standards, developing social reintegration programs that tend to reduce the probabilities of criminal recidivism and promoting the elimination of criminal record as part of the reintegration process.

- *Note: At the date of publication of this project, the P.P.A. of this year 2022 (management 2021) is still in development by Gendarmería de Chile, thus it is not included in this analysis.*
